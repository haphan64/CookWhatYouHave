#####Cook What You Have 

#####Have you ever stared into the abyss of your fridge wondering what you can make with just apples, flour, and milk?
Look no further! Cook What You Have will take a list of ingredients you have on hand and suggest recipes you can make using those ingredients.


####Html& CSS framework Foundation: Niv, Anthony
Created the entire HTML and made it work with the CSS and JS. 
CSS and framework Foundation
Created CSS and integrated Foundation framework, also merged the JS with the CSS and HTML to function.

####API 1 interaction: Eda 
Used Spoonacular API for “Search Recipes by Ingredients” and show it at results page when user enters ingredients and then when user clicks one of the recipes, used a 2nd end point for “Get Recipe Information” to show the title, instructions and full ingredients on a detail page.

###API 2 interaction: Ha 
Used Pexels.com for getting random food photos for background and added the credits for the photographer. And helped where necessary, worked all around while merging.
